# Post-Session Reflection Protocol

After completing your report, reflect on the session before finishing. This is silent — do not ask the user for input.

Consider:

1. **Gaps:** Did any check or workflow step fail to catch something it should have? Was there something worth testing that had no coverage?
2. **False signals:** Did any check produce a result that was misleading or not actionable?
3. **Tooling friction:** Did any CLI command, auth flow, or session setup behave unexpectedly?

For each observation, append an entry to `.qa-learnings/ledger.md` (create the file with a `# QA Learnings Ledger` header if it doesn't exist):

```
## [ISO timestamp] — [SOURCE]
[specific observation with examples from this session]
**Suggested change:** [which plugin file to change] — [what the change should be]
```

Replace `[SOURCE]` with the agent or skill name you were invoked as.

If you have zero observations, append nothing and say nothing about it.

If you recorded any observations, include this line in your output:
`[N] observation(s) recorded to .qa-learnings/ledger.md — run /review-learnings to synthesize, or /submit-learnings to share upstream.`

### Threshold Nudge

After recording observations (or if you recorded none), check whether `.qa-learnings/ledger.md` exists. If it does not, skip this check. If it does, count the total entries and unique sources by scanning for `## ` entry headers. If the ledger has **5 or more entries** OR **3 or more unique sources**, append an additional line:

`The learnings ledger has [N] entries from [M] sources. Consider running /submit-learnings to share with plugin maintainers.`

This nudge repeats every run until the user submits or clears the ledger.
