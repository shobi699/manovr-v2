# Adversarial Breaker — Reference Detail

Detailed attack checklists, auth setup code, severity definitions, and report format referenced by the adversarial-breaker agent.

## Auth Setup Code

### Loading a Profile

For single-profile dispatch: load the specified profile's cookies before testing.
For multi-profile dispatch (when the caller provides multiple profiles): your spawn prompt lists ALL available profiles. Switch between them to test auth boundaries:

```
For each profile in the provided list:
  1. Read .playwright/profiles/<profile-name>.json
  2. Load cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage via state-load:
```

```bash
playwright-cli -s={session} state-load ".playwright/profiles/{profile}.json"
```

3. Test the target screens with this role

### Clearing Auth State

Clear all auth state before switching profiles by loading a fresh session or navigating to a clean state.

4. Test the same screens unauthenticated

- If no profiles are specified, report that auth boundary testing is limited without profiles and proceed with unauthenticated testing only.

## Attack Categories

### 1. Input Abuse

- Extreme length: paste 10,000 characters into a text field
- Empty submission: submit forms with all fields empty
- Type confusion: put letters in number fields, numbers in email fields
- Special characters: `<script>alert(1)</script>`, SQL injection patterns (`'; DROP TABLE--`), emoji, unicode, null bytes
- Boundary values: 0, -1, MAX_INT, very long strings
- File uploads: wrong file type, oversized file, file with malicious name (`../../etc/passwd`)
- Copy-paste bombs: text with hidden unicode characters or zero-width spaces

### 2. Sequence Breaking

- Skip steps: go directly to step 3 of a multi-step form via URL
- Double submit: click the submit button rapidly multiple times
- Back button: complete step 2, go back to step 1, change data, go forward -- does step 2 reflect the change?
- Refresh mid-flow: refresh during a multi-step process -- is state preserved or lost?
- Parallel tabs: open the same form in two tabs, submit both -- what happens? *(MANUAL CHECK -- requires two concurrent browser sessions; document as untestable and recommend the user verify manually)*
- Direct URL access: navigate to authenticated pages by typing the URL without going through the normal flow

### 3. Auth Boundary Testing

- Unauthenticated access: try to reach protected pages/APIs without logging in
- Wrong role: access admin pages as a regular user (switch profiles)
- Expired session: load a page, wait (or manually clear cookies), then try to submit a form
- Token manipulation: if auth tokens are visible in cookies/localStorage, inspect their structure
- Logout + back button: log out, then press back -- can you still see protected content?
- IDOR: change IDs in URLs to access other users' data (`/user/123/settings` -> `/user/124/settings`)

### 4. State Corruption

- Delete while viewing: in another tab/profile, delete a resource that the current tab is viewing *(MANUAL CHECK -- requires concurrent sessions; document as untestable)*
- Edit while editing: two users (or tabs) edit the same resource simultaneously *(MANUAL CHECK -- requires concurrent sessions; document as untestable)*
- Stale data: load a list, navigate away, delete an item via the API or URL, navigate back -- does the original list handle the missing item gracefully?
- Orphaned references: delete a parent entity -- do child entities handle it gracefully?
- Counter manipulation: if there are counters or limits, try to exceed them through rapid actions

### 5. Error Handling

- Network interruption: start a form submission then go offline (disable network via Playwright)
- 404 pages: navigate to nonexistent routes -- is there a proper 404 page?
- API failure simulation: if possible, trigger API errors and observe client behavior
- Malformed responses: check how the UI handles unexpected API response shapes
- Timeout behavior: what happens during slow operations? Can the user get into a bad state?

### 6. Client-Side Security

- Console inspection: check for sensitive data in console.log output
- LocalStorage/cookies: inspect for tokens, PII, or secrets stored insecurely
- Source map exposure: check if source maps are publicly accessible
- Hidden form fields: look for hidden inputs containing sensitive data
- CSP headers: check if Content-Security-Policy is set

### 7. Security Headers

Check HTTP response headers for security best practices. Run this via `playwright-cli -s={session} eval`:

```javascript
(() => {
  return fetch(window.location.href, { method: 'HEAD' })
    .then(r => {
      const headers = {};
      r.headers.forEach((v, k) => headers[k] = v);
      
      const checks = {
        csp: {
          header: 'Content-Security-Policy',
          present: !!headers['content-security-policy'],
          value: (headers['content-security-policy'] || '').slice(0, 200),
          severity: 'HIGH',
          impact: 'Missing CSP allows XSS and data injection attacks'
        },
        hsts: {
          header: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
          present: !!headers['strict-transport-security'],
          value: headers['strict-transport-security'] || '',
          hasMaxAge: (headers['strict-transport-security'] || '').includes('max-age'),
          severity: 'HIGH',
          impact: 'Missing HSTS allows protocol downgrade attacks'
        },
        xFrameOptions: {
          header: 'X-Frame-Options',
          present: !!headers['x-frame-options'],
          value: headers['x-frame-options'] || '',
          severity: 'MEDIUM',
          impact: 'Missing X-Frame-Options allows clickjacking'
        },
        xContentType: {
          header: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
          present: !!headers['x-content-type-options'],
          isNosniff: headers['x-content-type-options'] === 'nosniff',
          severity: 'MEDIUM',
          impact: 'Missing nosniff allows MIME type confusion attacks'
        },
        referrerPolicy: {
          header: 'Referrer-Policy',
          present: !!headers['referrer-policy'],
          value: headers['referrer-policy'] || '',
          severity: 'LOW',
          impact: 'Missing referrer policy may leak sensitive URL information'
        },
        permissionsPolicy: {
          header: 'Permissions-Policy',
          present: !!headers['permissions-policy'],
          value: (headers['permissions-policy'] || '').slice(0, 200),
          severity: 'MEDIUM',
          impact: 'Missing permissions policy allows unrestricted access to camera, mic, geolocation'
        }
      };
      
      // Check Subresource Integrity on third-party scripts
      const scripts = document.querySelectorAll('script[src]');
      const thirdParty = [...scripts].filter(s => {
        try { return new URL(s.src).origin !== window.location.origin; }
        catch { return false; }
      });
      const withIntegrity = thirdParty.filter(s => s.hasAttribute('integrity'));
      
      checks.sri = {
        header: 'Subresource Integrity',
        thirdPartyScripts: thirdParty.length,
        withIntegrity: withIntegrity.length,
        missingIntegrity: thirdParty.length - withIntegrity.length,
        severity: thirdParty.length > 0 && withIntegrity.length === 0 ? 'MEDIUM' : 'LOW',
        impact: 'Third-party scripts without integrity hashes can be tampered with'
      };
      
      // Check cookie security flags (visible cookies only — HttpOnly not visible to JS)
      const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(c => c.trim()).filter(c => c.length > 0);
      checks.cookies = {
        header: 'Cookie Security',
        visibleCookies: cookies.length,
        note: 'HttpOnly cookies are not visible to JavaScript (which is correct). Only non-HttpOnly cookies are listed here.',
        severity: cookies.length > 5 ? 'MEDIUM' : 'LOW',
        impact: 'Excessive non-HttpOnly cookies may expose session data to XSS'
      };
      
      const missing = Object.entries(checks)
        .filter(([k, v]) => v.present === false && v.severity)
        .map(([k, v]) => ({ header: v.header || k, severity: v.severity, impact: v.impact }));
      
      return {
        check: 'security_headers',
        headers: checks,
        missingCount: missing.length,
        missing,
        highSeverity: missing.filter(m => m.severity === 'HIGH').length,
        mediumSeverity: missing.filter(m => m.severity === 'MEDIUM').length
      };
    })
    .catch(e => ({ check: 'security_headers', available: false, reason: e.message }));
})()
```

**Severity ratings:**
- **HIGH**: Missing CSP, missing HSTS on HTTPS sites
- **MEDIUM**: Missing X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy, SRI on third-party scripts
- **LOW**: Missing Referrer-Policy, minimal non-HttpOnly cookies

## Severity Ratings

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| CRITICAL | Data loss, security breach, or unrecoverable state | Auth bypass, data exposed to wrong user, permanent state corruption |
| HIGH | Feature broken, significant UX failure | Double-submit creates duplicate records, form data lost on refresh |
| MEDIUM | Unexpected behavior, poor degradation | Missing 404 page, vague error messages, stale data displayed |
| LOW | Minor annoyance, cosmetic under stress | Button flickers on rapid click, truncation with extreme input |

**Reproduction:**
1. Log out of the application
2. Navigate directly to /admin/users
3. Admin panel is accessible without authentication

**Expected:** Redirect to /login
**Actual:** Full admin panel rendered with user data visible
**Location:** Missing auth middleware on /admin/* routes

---

#### [HIGH] Double-submit creates duplicate records
**Reproduction:**
1. Navigate to /items/new
2. Fill in the form
3. Click "Create" rapidly 3 times
4. Navigate to /items

**Expected:** 1 item created
**Actual:** 3 identical items created
**Location:** No idempotency guard on POST /api/items

## Principles

- Be creative. The most valuable findings are the ones nobody thought of.
- Be systematic. Creativity without structure misses things. Apply every relevant attack category.
- Be specific. "The form can be exploited" is useless. Exact reproduction steps are required.
- Test both the UI and the underlying behavior. A button that appears disabled but still sends the API request is a finding.
- When you find something interesting, dig deeper. A minor finding often leads to a critical one.
- Do not cause permanent damage. If you discover a destructive operation (like deleting all data), document it but do not execute it without asking the user first.
