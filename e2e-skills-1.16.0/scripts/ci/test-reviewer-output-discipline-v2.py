"""Contract guards for e2e-reviewer output discipline (v2).

These constrain what a review may *say*, never what it may *detect*: no
pattern ID, title, severity, or framework-scope claim is asserted here, and
nothing in this file may be satisfied by weakening detection.

Motivation: a diagnostic pilot observed three response-discipline failures
that are independent of defect detection --

1. a clean result that volunteered selector/coverage/style advice outside the
   24-pattern catalog,
2. a fix accompanied by a weaker alternative that reduced what the test
   proves,
3. unconditional causal language ("always fails") where the evidence only
   supported a conditional outcome.

Each requirement below is asserted against the shipped skill surface so the
contract cannot silently regress into narrative prose.
