"""Render the field-scan ledger as a readable Markdown page.

Reads only the JSON ledger; runs no scan and makes no model call. The point of
the page is that a skeptic can click any row and land on the exact line in the
upstream repository at the pinned commit.

Two things this renderer must never blur:

  * A `[LLM-TRIAGE]` hit is a *candidate*, not a defect. The deterministic
    scanner cannot decide those alone, so they are counted and displayed apart
    from the P0 hits and are never folded into a defect total.
  * A scan is complete only when its exit status, Summary, and count
    reconciliation establish completion. Partial counts remain visible as floors.
